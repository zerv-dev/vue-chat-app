# vue-chat-app

This was a basic chat application I created so I can expose myself with Scoket.io an express.js

## Project setup
<<<<<<< HEAD
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and runs the client side http://localhost:8080/
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and runs the server side http://localhost:8081/
```
npm start
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

=======

* Go to your terminal and type in npm install
* Next type in npm run dev to serve the application
* Look up your ip adress(Either in Google or type in ipconfig in your terminal)
* Type in the ip adress with the port `8080` on another device. THi allows for multiple people to use  the chatrrom at once
