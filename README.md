# vue-chat-app

This was a basic chat application I created so I can expose myself with Scoket.io an express.js

## Project setup

* Go to your terminal and type in npm install
* Next type in npm run dev to serve the application
* Look up your ip adress(Either in Google or type in ipconfig in your terminal)
* Type in the ip adress with the port `8080` on another device. THi allows for multiple people to use  the chatrrom at once
